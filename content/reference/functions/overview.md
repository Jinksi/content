# Functions

The business logic of any application is usually what accounts for its real value.
**Graphcool Functions** follow an **event-driven** concept that gives you full control for the business logic needed in your individual use case.

Functions can be created in the [Functions View](!alias-ejamaid4ae) in the Console.

* There are several [function types]() to handle different use cases like **validation**, **initiating external workflows** or **custom authentication**.
* In general, a function can be executed in an [inline or webhook environment]().
* The [`graphcool-lib` package]() can be used to **make requests to a Graphcool API from within a Graphcool Function** or **manage common workflows for user management** and more.
* All functions have a [unified error handling concept]() that allows you to return detailed error messages from the API.

> Check the [collection of Graphcool Functions on GitHub](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/functions) for many community-contributed examples for Graphcool Functions.
