# Sending GraphQL Requests

The Relay API is supposed to be consumed by the GraphQL Client Relay. Other GraphQL clients such as Apollo Client or `graphql-request` and plain HTTP requests can also be used to communicate with the Relay API.

## Playground

The [Graphcool Playground](!alias-oe1ier4iej) can be used to explore and run GraphQL mutations, queries and subscriptions.

Before diving into a specific implementation, **it's often better to get familiar with the available operations in the playground first**.

## Setup Relay

Check the [quickstart](https://www.graph.cool/docs/quickstart/) to connect Relay with the Relay API.
