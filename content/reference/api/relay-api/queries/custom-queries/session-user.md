# The session user

If the request of a query contains authentication information on the [session user](!alias-geekae9gah#user-login), you can use the `user` query to query information on that user. All fields of the `User` type are available.

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/cixne4sn40c7m0122h8fabni1
disabled: true
---
query {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "user": {
        "id": "my-user-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If no user is signed in, the query response will look like this:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/cixne4sn40c7m0122h8fabni1
disabled: true
---
query {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "user": null
    }
  }
}
```

Note that you have to set appropriate [permissions](!alias-iegoo0heez) on the `User` type to use the `user` query.
