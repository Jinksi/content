# Fetch One Node in the Relay API

For each [type](!alias-ij2choozae) in your project, the Relay API provides an automatically generated query to fetch one specific node of that type. To specify the node, all you need to provide is its `id` or another unique field.

For example, for the type called `Post` a top-level query `Post` will be generated.

## Specifying the node by id

You can always use the [system field](!alias-uhieg2shio#id-field) `id` to identify a node.

> Query a specific post by id:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/cixne4sn40c7m0122h8fabni1
disabled: false
---
query {
  viewer {
    Post(id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n") {
      id
      title
      published
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "Post": {
        "id": "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n",
        "title": "My biggest Adventure",
        "published": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Specifying the node by another unique field

You can also supply any [unique field](!alias-teizeit5se#unique) as an argument to the query to identify a node. For example, if you already declared the `slug` field of the `Post` type to be unique, you could select a post by specifying its slug:

> Query a specific node by slug:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/cixne4sn40c7m0122h8fabni1
disabled: false
---
query {
  viewer {
    Post(slug: "my-biggest-adventure") {
      id
      slug
      title
      published
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "viewer": {
      "Post": {
        "id": "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n",
        "slug": "my-biggest-adventure",
        "title": "My biggest Adventure",
        "published": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: You cannot specify two or more unique arguments for one query at the same time.
