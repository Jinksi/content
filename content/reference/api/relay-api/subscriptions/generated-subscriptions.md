# Subscriptions

Currently, the Relay API does not directly contain generated subscriptions.

One approach is to [manually prepare the Relay Schema](https://www.graph.cool/forum/t/relay-modern-subscriptions/420) to include the required subscription types in the Relay Schema. Or check the [subscriptions in the Simple API](aip7oojeiv).
