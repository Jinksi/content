# Changelog

## Week 30/31 (July 24 - August 8)

* [API](!alias-heshoov3ai)

  * Setting required fields with a default value to `null` in a create or update mutation does not result in an internal server error anymore. Instead, the default value is used.

* [Schema Extensions](!alias-xohbu7uf2e)

  Thanks to all the beta tester for [the great feedback](https://www.graph.cool/forum/t/feedback-schema-extensions-beta/405/3?u=nilan) for Schema Extensions! These issues could be fixed:

  * Scalar lists can now be returned from a schema extension function.
  * Badly shaped return values are now handled gracefully and a helpful error message is returned.
  * URL validation for [webhook functions](!alias-hohl0iy1ji) is improved and helpful errors messages are returned.

* [Subscriptions](!alias-aip7oojeiv)

  You can now also use the connection parameter `authorization` (lower case) in your subscription client to authenticate subscription requests.

- With [graphql-request](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request) we published a minimal GraphQL client supporting Node and browsers for scripts or simple apps.
- We restructured our [examples repository](https://github.com/graphcool-examples) to help you find exactly the example that you need and also updated the onboarding accordingly.

- Enums are now managed on a project-level instead a type-level. This means you can define the possible values for one enum and create fields that use this enum in different types now.
- We added a new authentication provider that allows authentication based on a unique secret: **Anonymous Authentication**. Check [the latest Freecom chapter](!alias-pei9aid6ei) to learn how to use it!

## Week 17 (April 24 - April 30)

- We [released permission queries](![alias](https://www.graph.cool/blog/2017-04-25-graphql-permission-queries)-oolooch8oh/)! This is a novel approach for customizable authorization rules and we're very excited about the launch. Thanks to the **over 100 developers** in our beta program for throroughly testing this feature!
- We improved working with scalar lists in the databrowser.
- To make debugging subscriptions in the Playground easier, API errors are now directly printed.

## Week 16 (April 17 - April 23)

- [GraphQL Radio](https://graphqlradio.com) has been launched in cooperation with [Abhi Aiyer](https://twitter.com/AbhiAiyer).
- Many bugs have been fixed:
  - A subtle bug that prevented the deletion of nodes in self-relations with only a single field
  - Input data when creating or updating JSON fields is now properly validated and a GraphQL error is returned for invalid JSON.
  - The initial synchronization for the Algolia integration could be improved when using `DateTime` or `Json` fields.
- Improvements to relation filters, the File API and String fields:
  - It's now possible to filter nodes that are related to `null` in a to-one relation.
  - The size limit of uploading files to the [File API](!alias-eer4wiang0) has been increased to 200MB to support even big video files. File names now also support UTF-8 encoded characters.

- The [Homepage](https://graph.cool) including the [Documentation](https://graph.cool/docs) is now way more performant because we added code splitting and improved the Webpack configuration in general.
- The video about [building a booking system with GraphQl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8vwXEbnbFk) is the first episode of the Graphcool Webinar series.

## Week 12 (March 20 - March 26)

- For some people in the *Permissions Popup* it was not clear what we mean by "Apply to whole Model". A tooltip now explains what it's about. (closes [#536](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/536))
- Even when you didn't have changes, the databrowser asked if you really want to leave. This is fixed and now only real changes trigger this popup. (closes [#509](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/509))
- Fixed the links in the Onboarding for Learn Apollo & Learn Relay (closes [#756](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/756))
- The playground had the problem, that the docs didn't fully expand. Many of you have reported this, which we're really thankful for. It's now fixed and even on a small screen you can expand the docs much wider. (closes [#758](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/758), [#695](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/695))

## Week 11 (March 13 - March 19)

- Launch of the new Schema View. You now have a better overview over your schema through [Schema Editor](!alias-zezoo7uaph) and an awesome tool called [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager/), which we've now included in the Graphcool Console for you.

## Week 10 (March 6 - March 12)

- In this week there was a lot of progress regarding the Schema View, which will be released next week.
- The Console now uses [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) which cache all assets so the whole Console loads faster.
- Minor Bugs like the behavior of the String Cell in the Databrowser have been fixed. (closes
[#703](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/703),
[#715](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/715),
[#734](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/734),
[#741](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/741),
[#744](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/744))

## Week 9 (February 27 - March 5)

- Launch of our new subscriptions. Not only have we iterated over the subscription API to make it as powerful and easy to use as possible, but also created a unique debugging experience for your GraphQL Subscriptions in the new playground. Give it a try!
