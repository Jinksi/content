# Hello, GraphQL Radio

The GraphQL space is moving faster and faster as more companies adopt GraphQL and new awesome projects pop up every day. This Google [trend for "graphql"](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2009-04-04%202017-04-20&q=graphql) clearly shows the incredible momentum of the GraphQL ecosystem.

## Introducing GraphQL Radio

It's always been one of our most important goals to help people to learn more about GraphQL and its ecosystem. That's why today, we're launching [GraphQL Radio](https://graphqlradio.com).

GraphQL Radio is a regular podcast about every aspect of the GraphQL ecosystem reaching from amazing open-source projects to companies adopting GraphQL. It's a collaboration between us and our co-host [Abhi Aiyer](https://twitter.com/abhiaiyer) where we speak with experts and community members about GraphQL.

Each episode will be available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyjqrS8J8FCtqOtYoYcIqGw), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/graphql-radio) or as a regular [podcast on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/graphql-radio/id1227875536). You can also [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphqlradio) to stay up to date.

## Be our guest

Every two weeks, we'll invite a guest to the podcast. Last week we had Danielle Man from Apollo as our special guest to speak about GraphQL developer tools. If you're working on an exciting GraphQL project or recently moved to GraphQL, send us a message via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/graphqlradio) - we'd love to have you on our show! ðŸ’š

## Coming up next

**The next episode will be very special!** We'll be talking about the new release of Relay: [Relay Modern](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1362748677097871/relay-modern-simpler-faster-more-extensible/).

Together with Lee Byron and Joe Savona we'll dive deep into Relay Modern and talk about what's new. We've also invited Jonas Helfer and Sashko Stubailo from Apollo to discuss the similarities and differences between Relay and Apollo. This is going to be very exciting!
